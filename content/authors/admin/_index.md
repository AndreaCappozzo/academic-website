Statistician, currently postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods](https://www.dismeq.unimib.it/it) of [Milan-Bicocca University](https://www.unimib.it). Previously, PhD student in the same institution, working on ["Robust model-based classification and clustering: advances in learning from contaminated datasets"](https://boa.unimib.it/retrieve/handle/10281/262919/382625/phd_unimib_814541.pdf),  under the supervision of Professors [Francesca Greselin](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/francesca-greselin) and [Brendan Murphy](https://maths.ucd.ie/~brendan/). My research interests are related to the area of applied statistical learning, with particular focus on robust mixture models. I am a passionate [<tt>R</tt>](https://cran.r-project.org) user and a [<tt>Tidyverse</tt>](https://www.tidyverse.org) fan.
