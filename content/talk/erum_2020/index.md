abstract: Historically, the medical literature has largely focused on determining risk factors at an illness-specific level. Nevertheless, recent studies suggested that identical risk factors may cause the appearance of different diseases in different patients (Meijers & De Boer, 2019). Thanks to the joint collaboration of Heartindata, a group of data scientists offering their passion and skills for social good, and Avis Milano, the Italian blood donor organization, an enriched disease risk assessment model is developed. Multiple risk factors and donations drop-out causes are collectively analyzed from AVIS longitudinal records, with the final aim of providing a broader and clearer overview of the interplay between risk factors and associated diseases in the blood donors population.
