abstract: In a standard classification framework a set of trustworthy learning data are employed to build a decision rule, with the final aim of classifying unlabelled units belonging to the test set. Therefore, unreliable learning observations can strongly undermine the classifier performance, especially if the training size is small. Additionally, the test set may include classes not previously encountered in the learning phase. The present work introduces a robust adaptive model-based discriminant analysis (RAEDDA) capable of handling situations in which one or more of the following problems occur:outliers both in the training and in the test set, label noise in the training set and extra classes in the test not observed in the learning phase. An inductive EM-based procedure is employed for robust parameter estimation, making use of impartial trimming for identifying possible outliers and data with uncertain labels. Experiments on real data, artificially adulterated, are provided to underline the benefits of the proposed method.
